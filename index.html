                    <p>One facet of the conference programming we hope to organize is a juried art show soliciting works from artists around the world on the theme of Environmental Joy to be showcased in an exhibition during the conference. We are currently seeking any interested students or faculty who would be interested in supporting the planning and 
                        execution of this call for art. If you’re interested in learning more about the opportunity, please contact Julia Simon at julia.simon@yale.edu.</p>
